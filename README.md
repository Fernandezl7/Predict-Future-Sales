# Predict-Future-Sales
This project serves as a practical playground to apply and reinforce the machine learning concepts covered in our course, helping us prepare for the final exam. Using the "Predict Future Sales" dataset from Kaggle, we will develop a predictive model to forecast future sales based on historical transactional data.


##Project Scope & Objectives:
Key Steps Undertaken:
Data Exploration & Preprocessing:

Analyzed the dataset to understand its structure and identify missing values or inconsistencies.
Performed data cleaning, including handling missing values, duplicate records, and outliers.
Transformed categorical features and engineered new relevant features to enhance predictive power.
Feature Engineering & Selection:

Created lag-based features to incorporate historical trends.
Aggregated data at different time intervals to capture seasonality and trends.
Conducted feature selection to retain only the most impactful variables.
Model Development & Training:

Built and trained machine learning models using algorithms covered in the course.
Evaluated multiple models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), and Neural Networks to determine the best-performing approach.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Model Evaluation & Performance Analysis:

Assessed model accuracy using appropriate evaluation metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RÂ² Score.
Compared different models and analyzed performance improvements achieved through feature engineering and tuning.
Model Improvement Strategies:

Experimented with additional feature transformations and external data sources to enhance predictions.
Tested ensemble modeling techniques to boost prediction accuracy.
Optimized computational efficiency to ensure scalable model performance.
Final Submission & Documentation:

Compiled results, insights, and findings into a structured report.
